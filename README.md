clean-watch
===========

My first Pebble watch face, a clean simple look using Helvetica Neue. Now on the Pebble Appstore.

I made this mainly because there was no easy way to split up the hours and minutes using the Pebble API that I could find. This should also serve as an easy starting point for any Pebble Watchfaces anyone might want to make. Feel free to use my code (please do link back to my work though) and point out any bugs or style errors; I'm new to programming for the Pebble.
